1. List the execution time of the weblog aggregation query for Hive, SparkSQL, and SparkSQL on Parquet.

 a, For Hive 
	Time taken: 123.35 seconds, Fetched: 50 row(s)
 b, For SparkSQL
         Time taken: 28.418 seconds, Fetched 50 row(s)
	 -> 4 times faster
 c, For SparkSQL on parquet table: Time taken: 8.608 seconds, Fetched 50 row(s)
 
2. How many jobs does Hive launch? Does SparkSQL launch jobs?
Hive launches 2 jobs
SparkSQL does not launch jobs, 

3. Write a query which joins weblogs_parquet to user_info and counts the top 5 locations. List the locations.

Query: 
Select location, count(user_info.user_id) as log_count from user_info, weblogs_parquet where user_info.user_id = weblogs_parquet.user_id group by location order by log_count desc limit 5;
