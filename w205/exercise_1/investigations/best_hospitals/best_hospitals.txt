Approach: the ranking is based on average measure’s score of hospital, the lower the better.
However, I only consider hospitals with minimum number of reported measures because there’re hospitals with just a few measures reported and it’s not fair to compare them with hospitals where there’re many measures included. After examining the database, I think 25 is a reasonable minimum to set the bar.


2: What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.
I pick 3 hospital with high ranking (<10) but lower variations across measures. These are models of high quality care service providers. They are:


1. ST ALEXIUS MEDICAL CENTER
2. BAPTIST MEDICAL CENTER
3. ST LUKES HOSPITAL
